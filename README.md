1. cd into root (../mastermind_lite/)

2.      source virtual_env/bin/activate

3.      python3 run.py

---

* if you are new to python you will know you are inside the virtual_env if you see (virtual_env) in front of your user@path at the bottom of your terminal

* NOTE: if you want to print the answer to the terminal at the beginning of the game to experience some of the conditional logic in the winning conditional tree, simply pass show_ans=True into the instantiation of the Game class in run.py

* all the game logic is in game_class, the linter is being a bit weird on my end for the json module but everything works well
